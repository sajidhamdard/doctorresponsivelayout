//Semicolon in JavaScript
/*
In JavaScript, Semicolons are optional. Simple statements in JavaScript are generally followed by a semicolon character, just as they are in C, C++, and Java. 
JavaScript, however, allows you to omit this semicolon if each of your statements is placed on a separate line.
